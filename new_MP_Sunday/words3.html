            <h2>6 Steps To Nourish Yourself With Nutrition After Disordered Eating </h2>
            <p>There is so much more to health than eating well and exercising regularly. However, these two aspects of health are often over emphasized – especially by those of us, who in the past have struggled with body image issues or an unhealthy relationship to food.</p>
            <p>I spent the last two years completely ignoring any health and wellness advice about what to eat and how to move my body, in a quest to let go of my unhealthy relationship food, nutrition and exercise.</p>
            <p>For a self proclaimed foodie + yoga teacher, this was no easy task. However, mentally, these two years have done more for me than any superfood ever could. Physically, though I didn’t feel amazing – my energy wasn’t great, and my digestion was far from ideal.</p>
            <p>So when I reached a point where I KNEW deep down in my bones that I could trust myself, and love myself no matter what I looked like or how much I weighed – I felt the pull to start nourishing myself through food and nutrition again.</p>
            <p>I want to be really clear that it is of utmost importance that you do not rush this step. If I had of moved into this stage prematurely I have a big suspicion that it would have quickly become a slippery slope back to my old unhealthy ways of relating to food + my body. Trust the process darling, and allow it to unfold on it’s own divine timing. Ultimately – this is the most direct route to both health & happiness.</p>

            <p>You can think of these like cliff notes from my journey. This is a guide to show you how you can nourish yourself with healthy, nutrient dense food – without going all crazy pants again.</p>

            <h4>1.  How You Feel When You Eat Matters</h4>

            <p>If you eat something because you feel you should, or because you feel guilty about how you ate yesterday, those emotions will be transmitted into your food. I swear I can notice a positive difference in my digestion, and how energised I feel after a meal when I use this little gratitude prayer. Remember, not everyone has access to food, regardless of it’s nutritional value. We are so lucky.</p>

            <p>“It’s better to eat the wrong food with the right attitude than the right food with the wrong attitude” – Chinese Proverb</p>

            <h4>2. Social Connections & Belonging Are Incredibly Important For Health</h4>

            <p>I know for myself in the past, and many other who struggle with their relationship to food, we often avoid social situations where there will be unhealthy food with the intention of not-slipping-up-with-our-diet. However, there is an enormous amount of research that shows just how important social connections are for our health, wellbeing and longevity. Chris Kresser mentions a study on his podcast, and in his book that showed that a lack of social connections is a better predictor of early death, than smoking 15 cigarets per day. 15 CIGGY’S A DAY!!!</p>

            <h4>3. Practice Intuitive Eating</h4>

            <p>I had to put my intuitive eating skills to the test just this morning as I was writing this blog. I made some beautiful soaked oats, cooked in homemade bone broth for breaky. I make enough for two meals, and usually I’m full after one serving. However, today I could still feel my tummy rumbling after I ate my allocated portion. As I was packing away my oats for tomorrow, I caught myself. Why was I packing away this food when I was still hungry? Because I thought, normally this is enough food, and you don’t want to over eat. Well – the thing is each day is different, and to practice intuitive eating you need to be mindful of the present moment. Today, it wasn’t enough. So I filled up my bowl again – and now feel perfectly satiated. Bam!</p>

            <h4>4. Focus On Adding Healthy Foods Into Your Diet Rather Than Removing Unhealthy Foods</h4>

            <p>+ Can you add lemon water into your routine in the morning? + Can you focus on eating healthy fats – avocado, coconut oil, organic butter / ghee etc. ? + Can you eat more fresh fruit + veg? + What other nutritious foods do you know make you feel amazing? Can you bring more of those foods into your diet on a daily or weekly basis?</p>

            <p>Notice how there isn’t an emphasis on creating rules of what you can and can’t eat? Change your focus to eating loads of nutrient dense foods when you can – and don’t worry if you have a chocolate brownie every now and then.</p>

            <h4>5. Embrace The Fact That There Is No One Right Way To Eat & Learn What YOU Need To Feel Vibrant</h4>

            <p>Everyone is different. I feel very lucky that I have a deep understanding of my own body, constitution, and a keen sense of self awareness. However, I wasn’t born with these skills – I’ve developed them consciously, and so can you. There is no one-right-way to eat. You have to consider your own unique tastes, likes, dislikes, heritage, sensitivities, imbalances, and energy requirements. This often takes quite a bit of experimentation, and is always changing – from moment to moment, from season to season, year to year. The foods that I eat to help me feel energetic, strong and in the flow – may make you feel dull and lethargic, and vice versa.</p>

            <h4>6. Eat For Health AND Happiness</h4>

            <p>It’s my firm belief that if you aren’t eating food that fills you up on a soul level – you’re going to be chronically undernourished – even if you are eating what looks like an incredibly healthy diet. For a few years I ate a strict Paleo diet. If you are unfamiliar with this way of eating – a paleo or primal diet consists of eating lots of animal protein, healthy fats, fruit + veg ( no grains, dairy, or legumes ). On a physical level my body LOVES this way of eating. However – I don’t like meat. I never felt satisfied, and always felt like what I really wanted to eat was off limits.</p>

            <p>+ Lots of homemade bone broth ( for all the animal protein + nutrient goodness, without actually eating a steak ) + Lots of sustainably caught fish ( I especially love the brand goodfish )
                <br/> + A little bit of organic meat here and there – perhaps once / week or even less
                <br/> + Organic eggs
                <br/> + Loads of veggies + fruit, including sweet potatoes, and starchy veg of all kinds
                <br/> + Traditionally prepared gluten free grains ( i.e. soaked rice, oats etc )
                <br/> + Homemade fermented foods ( i.e. kimchi + sauerkraut )
                <br/> + A little bit of dairy ( who can say no to cheese, really? )
                <br/> + Heaps of healthy fats ( butter, coconut oil, olive oil, oily fish etc. ) + Oh, and chocolate + coffee – because life feels better with my two great loves by my side</p>
            <p>This way of eating feels like I am connected to all parts of my being, and honouring my needs as a whole individual, rather than prioritising one aspect of health over another. I have no doubt that they way you can nourish your body and soul may look very different from mine – and that’s great, everyone is unique – with different needs, tastes and desires.</p>
            <p>It’s taken me quite a while to arrive at this way of eating, and not without a lot of trial and error. Learning how to listen to the needs of your body + soul in relation to how you nourish yourself with food, is just another powerful reason to live a mindful, conscious life.</p>
            <p>I’ll say it again – just to make sure I’m super duper clear – there is no one-right-diet. The key to nourishing your body and soul through nutrition is to eat mindfully for health &amp; happiness. Creating rules and restrictions around what you can / can’t eat is very limiting, and can cause unnecessary stress and negativity.</p>
